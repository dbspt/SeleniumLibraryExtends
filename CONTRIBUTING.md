# Contributing to Selenium Library Extends

We welcome contributions to Selenium Library Extends of any kind including documentation, themes,
organization, tutorials, blog posts, bug reports, issues, feature requests,
feature implementations, pull requests, answering questions on the forum,
helping to manage issues, etc.

_Changes to the codebase **and** related documentation, e.g. for a new feature, should still use a single pull request._

## Code Contribution
